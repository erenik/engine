INSTRUCTIONS for GENERATING custom fONTS to the engine ^^
-- Emil

1. Install GIMP
2. Add the directory with the LayerMerger script so that it becomes available in GIMP http://docs.gimp.org/en/install-script-fu.html
3. Refresh available scripts [Filters -> Script-Fu -> Refresh Scripts]
4. New menu should now be available 'Script-Fu' with 'Layer Magic' -> 'Layer Merger'
5. 'Create new image' and 'Flatten layers' should probably be checked. 'Save to file' may be unwise as you want to verify the results first.
6. Click somewhere in the resulting image, as the image is usually not graphically updated straight away (may seem like an empty image at first).
