engine
======

Intro
-----

Real-time game/simulation engine project that I began with a friend in 2012.
Solo project since around a year ago or earlier!


Usage
-----

Currently usage is allowed for private projects only. 
If you wish to use it for any commercial projects please contact me first.


Contribution and participation
------------------------------

I am open to having more people join the project of developing this engine, but I am also strict and know what I want with it.
Currently I am using the engine as a test-bed for a school project. Until that is finished the project will be strictly read-only.
Steps for building it and making available binary files needed and external libraries will be tended to as well when the time is right.
