Real-time C++ engine architecture for games and interactivity
=============================================================

First scratches began with a Games in Windows course, but it all started in 2012 when me and a friend wanted to develop an RTS game. However, we didn't want to just make a game, but also an architecture around it: a game engine. After the summer of 2012 I continued using what we had started on in courses at school and developing it further in my spare time. 

During the spring of 2014 I used it in my specialization project at school where the Network solution was [re-worked a bit](http://focus.gscept.com/2014ip08/).

Later on during spring/summer of 2014 it was used again as the basis for my [thesis work](https://pure.ltu.se/portal/en/studentthesis/interaktiv-projektionskartlaggning%28bcca6075-4774-466c-9990-4f3cd91343d4%29.html) at Bosch Sensortec, and has been used since for various demonstrations of image-based interactivity.
